## 👋 About

I am a **Data Scientist** with a strong focus on **statistical modeling**, **reproducible analytics**, and **decision-oriented data science**.

My work combines rigorous statistical methods with applied machine learning, always grounded in real-world constraints such as data quality, interpretability, and stakeholder needs. I have extensive experience transforming complex, large-scale datasets into clear, actionable insights that support technical, managerial, and policy-level decision-making.

I currently work at **NIC.br**, contributing to analytical systems and studies related to **connectivity indicators** and **network quality** in Brazil.

> ⚠️ **Note on confidentiality**  
> Most of my professional work is developed within institutional environments and internal repositories.  
> For this reason, the projects presented here are described as **case studies**, focusing on problem framing, methodology, analytical reasoning, and impact — rather than source code.

## 🔍 Featured Projects

These projects represent my most relevant professional work as an applied Data Scientist, with an emphasis on statistical rigor, reproducibility, and decision support.

---
### Large-Scale Connectivity Assessment Using Administrative and Measurement Data  
End-to-end analytical study combining large-scale administrative records and continuous performance measurements to assess coverage, quality, and inequality in a national service infrastructure.

**Focus:** data integration at scale, robust aggregation, spatial and distributional analysis, decision-oriented indicators, public-impact analytics

[Read case study](case-studies/large-scale-connectivity-assessment.md)

### Temporal Convergence Analysis of Sequential Measurement Processes
Investigation of convergence and stability properties in sequential data, addressing how much data is enough and when measurements become decision-relevant.

*Focus:* time-series analysis,convergence analysis, stability diagnostics, robust aggregation, decision-oriented analytics
---
### Designing Robust Measurement Campaigns
Investigation of how sampling strategies, repetition rules, and tolerance thresholds affect the reliability and interpretability of measurement processes under variability.

**Focus**: experimental design, sampling strategies, statistical modeling, simulation, uncertainty-aware decision support



---

### Robust Indicator Design for Noisy Performance Measurements

Methodological development of robust indicators to summarize highly variable measurement distributions, balancing sensitivity to real changes and resistance to extreme values.

**Focus**: robust statistics, simulation-based validation, outlier handling, decision-oriented metric design


### **End-to-End Analytical Projects**
Full ownership of analytical projects, from problem formulation and data integration to modeling, visualization, and communication of results.
