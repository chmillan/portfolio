## 👋 About

I am a **Data Scientist** with a strong focus on **statistical modeling**, **reproducible analytics**, and **decision-oriented data science**.

My work combines rigorous statistical methods with applied machine learning, always grounded in real-world constraints such as data quality, interpretability, and stakeholder needs. I have extensive experience transforming complex, large-scale datasets into clear, actionable insights that support technical, managerial, and policy-level decision-making.

I currently work at **NIC.br**, contributing to analytical systems and studies related to **connectivity indicators** and **network quality** in Brazil.

> ⚠️ **Note on confidentiality**  
> Most of my professional work is developed within institutional environments and internal repositories.  
> For this reason, the projects presented here are described as **case studies**, focusing on problem framing, methodology, analytical reasoning, and impact — rather than source code.

## 🔍 Featured Projects

These projects represent my most relevant professional work as an applied Data Scientist, with an emphasis on statistical rigor, reproducibility, and decision support.



### **Decision-Oriented Machine Learning**
Application of machine learning methods in contexts where interpretability, validation, and analytical insight are more important than raw predictive performance.

- Dimensionality reduction and feature analysis  
- Model evaluation and error analysis  
- Responsible and applied ML practices  

**Focus:** supporting decisions, not just predictions

---
### Designing Robust Measurement Campaigns
Methodological analysis of sampling strategies and tolerance rules for repeated measurements, common in compliance, audit, and performance evaluation contexts.

*Focus:* statistical modeling, simulation, uncertainty-aware decision support

[Read case study](case-studies/robust-measurement-campaign-design.md)

---
### Temporal Convergence Analysis of Sequential Measurement Processes
Analysis of temporal dynamics and aggregation robustness in sequential data, a recurring problem in domains such as People Analytics, compliance monitoring, and quality assessment.

*Focus:* time-series analysis, statistical criteria design, decision-oriented analytics

---


### **End-to-End Analytical Projects**
Full ownership of analytical projects, from problem formulation and data integration to modeling, visualization, and communication of results.

- Close collaboration with technical teams and public managers  
- Translation of complex analyses into clear insights  
- Support for strategic and operational decisions
