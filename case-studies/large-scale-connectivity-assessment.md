## Context
This project addresses the challenge of evaluating large-scale service infrastructure by combining nationwide administrative records with continuous performance measurements.

## Data
- Nationwide administrative microdata  
- Continuous automated performance measurements  
- Millions of observations across thousands of entities  

## Methodology
- Integration of heterogeneous data sources  
- Robust aggregation using distribution-aware summaries  
- Normalization of performance metrics relative to demand  
- Spatial and inequality analysis  

## Key Findings
- Nominal coverage does not imply adequate quality  
- Strong regional disparities persist  
- Aggregate indicators mask local variation  

## Impact
- Presented at conferences and technical forums  
- Widely covered by national media  
- Used to support public monitoring and evaluation  

## Transferable Skills
- Large-scale data integration  
- Robust statistical summarization  
- Indicator design for decision-making  
- Communication of complex analyses
