# Engineering Case Studies  
**Reproducible analytical systems and production-oriented design**

This section presents selected projects focused on the engineering layer of analytical work: system architecture, reproducibility, containerization, and deployment-ready design.

While the analytical track emphasizes statistical modeling, this track highlights how analytical systems are structured to be stable, scalable, and reproducible under real-world constraints.

## End-to-End Engineering of an Analytical Platform

Design and evolution of a containerized analytical system combining database optimization, API integration, reactive tuning, and CI-driven deployment.

**Engineering scope:**

- Multi-stage Docker builds and environment isolation  
- Schema versioning and materialized views  
- API development with controlled DB connections  
- Reactive optimization in Shiny  
- Load testing and validation
